## Project Info

To prove our competence, we need to build a GraphQL server that will pull data from several different sources. We have:

1. A Mongo database of people hosted on Atlas
2. A list of women (`women.json`)
3. A quote generator of Ron Swanson
4. The Best Buy API with product info for cameras and tvs

## Working with the Files

This project has two branches: `start` and `finished`. If you'd like to see the project running, go to: [https://pwmct.herokuapp.com](https://pwmct.herokuapp.com).
